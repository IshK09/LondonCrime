# LondonCrime

The project cleans the london crime data from [London Data Store](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/recorded_crime_summary) and cleans it to enable analysis.

Data is saved as a csv. 

The code is located in file [LondonCrime.R](https://github.com/IshK09/LondonCrime/blob/master/LondonCrime.R) and it requires [LondonBoroughLevelCrime.csv](https://github.com/IshK09/LondonCrime/blob/master/LondonBoroughLevelCrime.csv) as an input

Output is written to a file called *London Crime 2008-18.csv*
